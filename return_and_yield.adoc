= Return & Yield

`pass:[<=]` _<value>_::
* (`FUNC`) Return the value without executing anymore code in the current function.
* (`ITER`) Yield the value without executing anymore code in the current generator.
`pass:[<-]` _<value>_::
* (`FUNC`) Append a buffer with this value. The buffer is returned when the execution of the function is done. The statement
  `pass:[<=] x;` appends `x` and returns the buffer without executing anymore code in the current function. `pass:[<=];` will return the
  buffer without appending anything and `pass:[<=] None;` will append `None` to the buffer and returns it.
* (`ITER`) Yield the value.
`<~` _<value>_::
* (`FUNC`) The "early return" is similar to the `pass:[<-]` arrow. The difference is that in this case the buffer is not
  a list but a single value. The buffer is overriden when a `pass:[<-]` is encountered and vice versa.
* (`ITER`) This is not available inside a generator.
Block Tail::
* A block tail is an expression at the end of a block `{ ... }` which does not end with a semicolon. The result of the
  expression will be the rusult of the block.
* A block tail cannot be used with a `pass:[<-]`.



All the snippets are roughly the same.
